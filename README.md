# OrbitalPathfinder

	From the advent of code 2019, day 6 (https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6). This takes a text
document of "orbits". Part 1 calculates the number of orbits. Part 2 gives the shortest number of 
orbits between two planets. It has been modified to run through the command line in the following 
format:

	part filename.txt planet1 planet2

examples:

	Part 1) 1 input-simple-dos.txt

	Part 2) 2 input-simple-dos.txt YOU SAN

# What I Learned:

	-How to use a graph data structure
	-Shortest path algorithm
	-Breadth first vs depth first traversals
